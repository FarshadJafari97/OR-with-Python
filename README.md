 optimization and operations research in Python!
 This semester, I had the opportunity to take a course on operations research and learn about various techniques
 for solving optimization problems. As a Python enthusiast, 
 I was curious about how I could apply the concepts I learned in class to real-world problems and implement them using Python.
I have collected some of the optimization problems I worked on throughout
the semester and solved them using Python. My hope is that this notebook can serve as 
a resource for others interested in optimization and operations research and demonstrate how Python can be a powerful tool
for solving these types of problems. Feel free to explore the code and adapt it to your own needs.
I welcome any feedback or suggestions you may have!
